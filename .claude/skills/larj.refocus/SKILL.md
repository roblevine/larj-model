description: Refocus a DDD Event Storming session that has strayed from its structured facilitation protocol
---

The conversation has drifted from the structured DDD Event Storming facilitation protocol. Your job is to get back on track.

## Steps

1. **Review the session template** in `session-template.md` to recall the expected structure and phase progression.

2. **Review the full conversation history** and determine:
   - Which phase are we in? (Phase 1: Happy Path, Phase 2: Deep Dive, Phase 3: Aggregates, Phase 4: Supporting Patterns)
   - What exit criteria have been met for the current phase?
   - What exit criteria remain?
   - What artifacts exist and are they up to date?
   - Where exactly did the conversation stray?

3. **Review the facilitation protocol** in `custom-instructions.md` to re-ground yourself in the hard rules and checkpoint loop.

4. **Produce a brief status report** for the SME:
   - Current phase and progress within it
   - What's been captured so far (summarize key artifacts)
   - What still needs to be done in this phase
   - Any items that were discussed off-track that should be parked

5. **Resume the session** by asking ONE follow-up question that picks up where the structured facilitation should be, following the checkpoint loop and all hard rules.

Do not scold the SME or make the refocus feel disruptive. Frame it as a natural recap before continuing.
